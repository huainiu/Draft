The Factory Method Pattern defi nes an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which
class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.


It’s time to roll out the official defi nition of the Factory Method Pattern:

As with every factory, the Factory Method Pattern gives us a way to encapsulate the
instantiations of concrete types. Looking at the class diagram below, you can see that the
abstract Creator gives you an interface with a method for creating objects, also known as the
“factory method.” Any other methods implemented in the abstract Creator are written to
operate on products produced by the factory method. Only subclasses actually implement
the factory method and create products.

As in the official definition, you’ll often hear developers say that the Factory Method lets
subclasses decide which class to instantiate. They say “decides” not because the pattern
allows subclasses themselves to decide at runtime, but because the creator class is written
without knowledge of the actual products that will be created, which is decided purely by
the choice of the subclass that is used.
