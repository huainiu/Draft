/**
 * Created by Michael.Shreiber on 12/16/13.
 *
 * null out references once they become obsolete. In the case of our Stack class,
 * the reference to an item becomes obsolete as soon as itâ€™s popped off the stack.
 * The corrected version of the pop method looks like this:
 *
 * Nulling out object references should be the exception rather than the norm.
 * The best way to eliminate an obsolete reference is to let the variable that contained
 * the reference fall out of scope. This occurs naturally if you define each variable in
 * the narrowest possible scope.
