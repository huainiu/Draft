1.  Securing a Web Server with SSL and JSSE:
    1.1 JSSE - Java Secure Socket Extension.
    1.2 SSL  -  Secure Sockets Layer.

    The simplest way to use SSL is simply to get your ServerSocket from an SSLServerSocketFactory
    instead of using the ServerSocket constructor directly. The SSLServerSocketFactory returns
    a ServerSocket that is set up to do SSL encryption.
    For an example, see class JSSEWebServer0.
